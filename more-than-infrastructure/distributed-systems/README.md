# Distributed Systems

This isn't a guide on how to architect distributed systems but if you are not familiar with the design of distributed (micro)services then you are likely to struggle to gain the full benefit of Serverless architectures.&#x20;

* All the consideration of distributed systems apply to serverless
* great fit for (micro)service architecture
